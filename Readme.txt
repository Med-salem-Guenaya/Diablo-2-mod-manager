                       **********************
                            What is this?
                       **********************
This is a grouping of Mods that i made sure are compatible with each other:
     -PlugY
     -MultiRes
     -Giga inventory
     -Median XL
     -Median XL sigma









                        *********************
                            Instructions:
                        *********************



1-Most importantly set Video Mode to: DDraw (important!),this is to make sure that MultiRes doesn't go glitching on you.
     -> DO NOT! and i mean DO NOT choose the last resolution in the list of options.......You're gonna brake the graphics handler almost certaintly....sooo stop it, get some help.  

2.Run *D2 create shortcut.bat*.

3.Run *D2 Giga inventory.bat* that is if you want to have a gigantic inventory.

4.Run *D2 Patcher.bat* and choose the option you want......i personely prefer either:
		v1.13c (MultiRes + PlugY).................for the OG's
		v1.13c (MultiRes + PlugY + Median XL)
  ->If you have chosen to play with Giga inventory always run the game through the Desktop shortcut.

5.Have a blast

->Now you should not and i mean *NOT* run the game through the  Desktop Shortcut that is called *Diablo 2* if you have Median XL actived or you will get an error, instead run through the one called *Diablo 2 + Median*, that is because Median XL is not compatible with Giga inventory MOD.

->Also if you have sigma as the current active option run the game through the  Desktop Shortcut that is called *Diablo 2 + sigma* or you will most likely triger an error.


                        *********************
                          Additional Notes:
                        *********************



Now you might notice that when you choose Median XL the skill reset button is abscent, that is because The developpers of Median XL have disabled it because of compatibility issues.

I have also seperated the saves for the options 2, 3, 5, 6 just to eliminate complaints about character save compatibility.

Also when you choose Median XL, in the bottom left it will not say +MultiRes but it is in fact Loaded you just need to get in the game to change the resolution........again DO NOT choose the last resolution in the list of options.

To reassign stat point one by one use *alt*, to completly reset a certain stat use *alt + left shift*.


PlugY automatically disables features on realm (Battle.net).
But it's always recommended to disable any third software when you go on realm (Battle.net).
- In multiplayer game, verify that the server has the same configuration.
- Remember : PlugY doesn't support realms (Battle.net).
